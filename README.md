## Panda UI

The GitHub home of Panda UI a UI library maintained by Timothy Bridge.
Visit https://red-panda.studio for the full docs, showing use cases and
customizability.
The UI library has been written in Typescript and is usable in React or NextJS.
Remember with NextJS to set `'use client'` in the file you import them into, to use
the onClick functionality.

This is the development repo, where I will be updating components and publishing
to NPM. 
It also has my component test environment for previewing a import checking.
